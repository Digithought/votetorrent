# Optimystic - Distributed Database System

## Overview

The transaction system described here uses a logical transaction log combined with block-based storage.  This scheme can be used as a stand-alone logging system, or can be coupled with a tree or other data structure.  This design is based on the transaction system of [AliveBase](https://github.com/Digithought).

This scheme employs a logical transaction log combined with block-based storage, supporting both single-collection and cross-collection transactions. The system utilizes a multi-phase process for propagating updates, committing transactions, and checkpointing affected blocks, ensuring consistency across distributed collections while allowing for concurrent operations through conditional commits.

The system may experience hotspots at the log tail block, but the tail is transient so these should distribute over time.  There is also the potential for cascading failures in upstream multi-collection transactions, but subsequent transactors are always free to investigate dependencies before committing.  Overall it offers a lockless design that enables transactions to proceed after retries, providing both flexibility and efficiency. The scheme also incorporates robust failure handling mechanisms, validation processes based on atomic writes and peer communication, and optimizations such as an optional sync phase and efficient advertisement of newer block transactions.

### Summary

#### Single collection transactions:
* Each collection maintains log of logical transactions, each with:
  * revision, transaction ID, block IDs, logical actions
* Logical log stored physically as linked list of blocks
* Log header block references head and tail block IDs
* Blocks each versioned by associated transaction ID and revision number - can read from previous revision back to history TTL
* Phase 1 - Pend: `pend()`s are posted to all affected blocks (w/ TTLs) - these don't update the revision
* Phase 2 - Commit: Transaction is appended to tail of the log, obtaining a new revision
* Phase 3 - Propagate: All affected blocks' revisions are updated
* Phase 4 - Checkpoint: Checkpoint record appended to tail block as propagation completes
* Before reading from collection, obtain outstanding transaction ID and revisions stated by checkpoint and intervening transactions
* Explicitly mention uncheckpointed and uncommited transactions when reading from block storage 
  - ensures read includes uncheckpointed and uncommitted transactions
  - reinforces commits (in case committer fails to propagate)

#### Cross-collection transactions:
* Proceeds as in single collection transaction, except that:
  * Logical entry for each collection includes all affected collection IDs - the transaction is considered to be conditional on all of these collections
  * If any of the collections fail to commit by the TTL, after retries if no collisions, the transaction fails - all conditional transactions are considered aborted.
  * If a transaction is aborted, a reciprocal transaction (noting the conditional commit) is posted.  Poster's of any transactions subsequent to a conditional commit are responsible to compensate for the abort, since they were aware of the conditional commit.  If the transaction succeeds, a checkpoint is appended indicating that the condition is removed.

## Collections

A collection is the fundamental unit of data storage in Optimystic.  It consists of a transaction log, as well as a type-specific structure, such as a tree, all build on top of block storage.  It also represents the smallest scope of transaction processing.

Types of collections include:
* **Diary** - an append-only list of entries
* **Tree** - a dictionary or index like structure that stores entries in terms of a key based order
  * **Hashed Tree** - a tree where each node contains a hash of its children or entries (Merkle tree)

Each collection has a unique identifier, which is a reference to a block ID containing the collection's header.

## Block Storage

Block Storage is composed of:
* **Revisions** - a set of revisions, each of which contains:
  * **Transform** - the changes represented by the revision
  * **Materialized block (optional)** - materialization of the block at that revision
* **Pending transforms** - pending transforms, which can be requested as part of a `get()` operations, and/or committed to the block

If a revision is requested that is not materialized, the block storage will materialize the block, using an older materialization and the necessary transforms.

Block Storage may choose to sweep old revisions and materialized blocks to free up space.  If an older revision is needed, the storage system will attempt to retrieve it from an archive.

## Block Repository Client

A Block Repository Client collectively represents block storage across the network, with peers proximal to a block's address being responsible to provide Block Storage.  Block revisions are identified by a Transaction ID, which is coordinated across block repositories. The Block Repository Client offers four core operations: 
- `get()` to retrieve the latest or a specific version of a set of blocks
- `pend()` to store the given block transforms as a pending transaction
- `cancel()` to cancel a pending transaction
- `commit()` to commit a pending transaction

Block client operations, in general, apply to multiple blocks, and are turned into multiple block-specific operations.  Furthermore, because a given block's repository role is shared by multiple peers in proximity to the block ID address, a coordinator is selected for each block by the client, and the coordinator is responsible for propagating the transaction operations to other peers replicating the block's storage, and for achieving consensus on the transaction.  Transactions are also sent to archive nodes asynchronously, as soon as consensus is reached.

For details, see [repository](./doc/repository.md).

## Transactions

Transactions are actions scoped to one or more collections.  There are two main layers to transactions:
* **Logical actions** - Actions applied to the collection are affected against the collection's logical structure (e.g. append to a tree), and the actions are also appended to the logical transaction log.
* **Block transforms** - Each logical action ultimately translates to block level transforms, including the appending of the transaction log, which is stored as a chain of blocks.

The transaction log is physically represented as a linked list of blocks, each containing a set of logical log entries.  The collection header block points to the tail block, and each block points to the prior block in the chain.

To apply a transaction to the network:
1. The client sends `pend()` requests to all involved blocks, containing the block transforms.  This allows the transform payload to be communicated to all involved blocks, prior to commitment.
2. The client specifically attempts to `commit()` the request to the tail block of the transaction log.  Successful commits to this block represent the "tip of the spear" for the transaction - if this commit succeeds, the transaction will ultimately succeed.
3. The client propagates the commit to the remaining involved blocks.
4. Once commit confirmation is received for all involved blocks, a checkpoint entry is appended to the transaction log.

Prior to checkpointing, the transaction is still complete, but client's must not assume that all block storage repositories have received the commit, so any `get()` requests should include the transaction ID / revision information, so that the storage repository will a) be informed of the commit; and b) be sure to retrieve the committed revision.

The resulting transaction model provides optimistic concurrency control, ensuring safe and reliable ACID mutations.  If a given transaction is stale, as in it is not "based on" the latest committed revision, the transaction will fail.  If this happens, the transaction must be retried as follows:
1. The client abandons its pending block operations
2. The winning transaction's logical actions are loaded by the client, and any conflicts resolved
3. The client replays its own logical actions into a new set of block transforms
4. The client attempts to pend and commit the new set of block transforms

## Archival Storage

VoteTorrent's archival storage system, called **Arachnode**, organizes storage nodes into concentric rings, with each ring representing progressively finer partitions of the keyspace. The outermost ring, called Ring Zulu, handles transactions and dynamic ranges based on an overlap factor rather than specific partition boundaries. Any storage nodes in the innermost ring, ring 0, would store the entire keyspace, while nodes in outer rings manage smaller, more specific portions of the keyspace. This design allows nodes to adjust their range responsibility based on storage capacity, dynamically shifting to more granular rings when needed.

Nodes in Arachnode maintain references to neighboring nodes within their ring and across adjacent inner and outer rings to facilitate data propagation and retrieval. As storage capacity reaches its limit, a node moves outward, adjusting its range and offloading excess data to nodes in the inner rings. This self-organizing system balances load across the rings, with global demand monitored through overlap factor sampling. This adaptive structure provides scalable, efficient storage management, with nodes dynamically adjusting their participation in rings to meet the systemâ€™s overall storage and processing needs.

For details, see [Arachnode](./doc/arachnode.md).

## Transaction Client

### Block mirroring
* The client should read and maintain a synchronized copy of all participant blocks from the repository
* The first read for any collection should be from the header block, which points to the tail of the logical log, which should be the second read
* With the LSN and the uncheckpointed transaction IDs in hand, the client can read any other blocks that may be part of the collection
* All changes to blocks should be tracked locally along with the logical log entries
* Modifications to blocks should be made into copies, maintaining the original versions
  
### Synchronization

#### When to sync
* If much time has passed since the blocks were read, the client should sync before posting pending updates
* Syncing will also be necessary if the transaction is rejected due to stale data

#### How to sync
* To sync, the client will:
  * Load new logical log entries from the tail block
  * Starting from unmodified cached blocks, play the read logical log entries, capturing physical changes in "unchanged" blocks
  * Note any conflicts from the loaded logical log entries, from our list - affect our list if necessary
  * Play our logical log entries, capturing physical changes as changed blocks and transforms

## Blocks

### Structures

#### Log Block:
- [**Previous Block ID**]: The ID of the prior block in the chain
- **Starting Log Sequence Number**: A monotonically increasing number for log entries - the LSN of the first committed entry in the block.
- **Entries**: list of:
  - **Transaction ID**: The ID of the transaction
  - **Operations**: A set of logical operations

#### Block Repository:
- **Pending**: list of:
  - **Transaction ID**: Used to identify the transaction while pending
  - **Transform**: The set of physical mutations to this block
  - **Expiration**: A time after which the transaction becomes in-doubt; this block should proactively determine resolution at this point
- **Revisions**: list of:
  - **LSN**: The LSN of this version
  - **Transform**: The set of physical mutations represented by this revision
  - [**Block**]: Materialized block for this revision - always present for current version
  - [**Expiration**]: The time after which this revision is eligible for garbage collection - never present for current version
  - **Conditions**: list of zero or more:
    - **Block ID**: Other block on which this revision is conditional
    - [**Signature**]: The signature of the other block - presence indicates that this revision is checkpointed
- **Aborted Revisions**: list of revisions that have been aborted

- **Commits**: corresponds to committed entries -list of:
  - **Conditional Collection IDs**: RemainingIDs of collections that are conditionally depended on

#### Block Transaction:
- **Block ID**: The ID of the block
- **Transaction ID**: The ID of the transaction - shared across blocks and collections
- **Transform**: The set of physical mutations to the block
- **Expiration**: A time after which the transaction becomes in-doubt; any involved node should proactively determine resolution at this point

#### Block Repository Interface



#### Block Network Interface

- `Pend(blockTransaction, failIfPending: boolean): success<pending: blockTransaction[]> | failure<missing: blockTransaction[]>` - posts a pending transaction for the block
  - Does not update the version of the block, but the transaction is available for explicit reading, and for committing
  - If the transaction targets the correct version, the call succeeds, unless failIfPending and there are any pending transactions - the caller may choose to wait for pending transactions to clear rather than risk racing with them
  - If the transaction targets an older version, the call fails, and the caller must resync using the missing transactions
  
- `Cancel(id): void` - cancels a pending transaction
  - If the given transaction ID is pending, it is canceled

- `Commit(id): conditions | failure<missing: blockTransaction[]>`
  - If the transaction references the current version, the pending transaction is conditionally committed
    - The returned conditions are those uncommitted inherited from older transaction(s) - if any of those are aborted, this transaction will implicitly be aborted
    - If the transaction mentions other collections, those are assumed conditions - returned conditions only list inherited conditions
  - If posting from an old version, unknown transactions are returned in the failure - must resync

- `Abort(id): void` - aborts a conditional committed transaction
  - Aborts the conditional transaction on all blocks



#### Block
- Block header
- Block body

#### Transform
- Set of block inserts, updates, and deletes

#### Overall Transaction
-Set of block transforms

The logical structure of a transaction can be represented as follows:

## Failure handling

#### Failure to propagate
#### Failure to commit
#### Failure to prepare
#### Failure to checkpoint
#### Effect on successive transactions

## Validation
* Block level validation is based on the distributed storage system; this system assumes a block repository with atomic writes as long as posting from most recent version
* General pattern is that all transaction phases are dictated by TTLs; if the coordinator/client fails to notify any party by the TTL, the party is to reach out to peers to resolve
* Each phase requires all parties to acknowledge before moving on
* TODO: distributed, signature based validation of log tail writes, and general block writes

## Optimizations
* Optional Phase 0 - Sync: Read latest LSN and integrate before wasting time posting pending updates
* Optimization - when posting pending updates, note any unknown block transactions - sync needed
