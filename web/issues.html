<h2>Problems with Current Voting Methods</h2>
<p>When more than two candidates run in an election, a winner might be elected with only a plurality. In this case, a runoff election would be ideal but is rarely practical. If elections could be conducted electronically where each voter participates using their mobile phone, runoff elections would now be feasible. Runoff elections are preferable because the winner will always be elected with more than 50% of the vote.</p>
<p>It is difficult for people to trust in-person voting because their ballot just goes into a box and they have no way to verify that it has actually been counted correctly. Current mail-in voting is subject to fraud since anyone can fill out a ballot and send it in. With either in-person or mail-in voting, the voter has no way to verify that their vote has been counted. Additionally, with mail-in voting, one's vote is not truly secret since those opening the ballots can see who sent in each ballot.</p>
