<h2>Why a New Voting System is Needed</h2>
<p>Voters have low confidence that elections are fair and impartial. It seems a bit of a conflict of interest for government officials to conduct an election fairly if it might result in them losing. Ideally, elections would be conducted by the community rather than the government officials who themselves are running for re-election. However, it is difficult for the community to conduct an election because they are usually not organized except by way of their government.</p>
