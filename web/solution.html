<h2>How votetorrent Solves Voting Issues</h2>
<p>Current peer-to-peer networking and cryptographic technology enable us to conduct a vote largely coordinated by the community. This is the purpose of votetorrent. The government (the authority) needs only to publish the parameters of the election and certify the results. Each voter can verify that their vote has been properly counted. Everyone can see who voted, but not how they voted. Much of the potential for fraud or incompetence on the part of those conducting the election is removed.</p>
